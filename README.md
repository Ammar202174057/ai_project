This Python program predicts the number of calories burnt based on exercise duration, heart rate, and age using a linear regression model. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Data Setup:** 
   - Creates a small dataset with columns for `Duration`, `HeartRate`, `Age`, and `Calories`.

2. **Feature and Target Selection:**
   - Uses `Duration`, `HeartRate`, and `Age` as features to predict the `Calories`.

3. **Data Splitting:**
   - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Trains a linear regression model on the training data.

5. **Prediction:**
   - Uses the model to predict calorie burn on the test data.

6. **Evaluation:**
   - Calculates the mean squared error between the predicted and actual calorie values to assess accuracy.

7. **Output:**
   - Prints the mean squared error and compares predicted calories with actual values for the test set. 

This program demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow using linear regression.
